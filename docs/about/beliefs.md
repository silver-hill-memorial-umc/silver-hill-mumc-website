# Our Beliefs

Silver Hill Memorial United Methodist Church is part of The United Methodist Church, a global denomination that seeks to be faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

## The United Methodist Church

As United Methodists, we affirm the traditional Christian beliefs while embracing a spirit of theological diversity and open dialogue. We believe in:

### The Trinity
- **God the Father** - Creator and sustainer of all life
- **Jesus Christ** - God's son, our savior and redeemer
- **The Holy Spirit** - God's presence active in our world today

### Scripture
We believe the Bible is the word of God and the primary source of our faith and practice. We interpret Scripture through the lens of tradition, reason, and experience.

### Grace
God's love and forgiveness are freely given to all people. We believe in:
- **Prevenient Grace** - God's love that comes before we even know it
- **Justifying Grace** - God's forgiveness that makes us right with God
- **Sanctifying Grace** - God's transforming power that helps us grow in holiness

### The Sacraments
We celebrate two sacraments instituted by Christ:
- **Baptism** - A sign of God's grace and our acceptance into the Christian community
- **Holy Communion** - A means of grace where we remember Christ's sacrifice and receive spiritual nourishment

## Our United Methodist Heritage

The United Methodist Church traces its roots to John Wesley's revival movement in 18th-century England. Wesley emphasized:

- **Personal Holiness** - Growing in love of God and neighbor
- **Social Justice** - Working to transform society
- **Practical Divinity** - Faith that makes a difference in daily life

## Open Hearts, Open Minds, Open Doors

This motto reflects our commitment to:
- **Open Hearts** - Welcoming all people with God's love
- **Open Minds** - Engaging faith with intellectual honesty
- **Open Doors** - Creating inclusive communities of grace

## Questions Welcome

We believe faith involves both the heart and the mind. Questions, doubts, and honest searching are not only welcome but encouraged as part of the journey of faith.
