Greetings, Silver Hill Memorial UMC and the Spartanburg Community,

Reverend Morris Waymer Jr., a man deeply rooted in family values, was born and raised in Orangeburg, SC, where his parents still reside. His commitment to family is a cornerstone of his life. He is married to the former Nickey Hallums of Easley, SC, and they have been blessed with two daughters, Ivery and Kierston, one son, London, and five grandchildren, who bring them immense joy and love.

Reverend Waymer's journey of faith is marked by his academic achievements and extensive experience. He graduated from Claflin College with a Bachelor’s in Biology and Emory University with a Master of Divinity Degree. Since 1999, he has served as a pastor in the South Carolina Annual Conference, bringing his wisdom and knowledge to churches in the Upstate, Pee Dee, and Lowcountry. His return to the Upstate is a testament to his commitment to this community.

Ministry involves serving the church and its surrounding community. He has served as Chaplain of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance. During his time in North Charleston, the North Hope Cooperative Ministry raised money for local ministries, participated in Lenten services, reached out to local elementary schools to help, and strived to collaborate in all we did. He is also an advocate for Racial Reconciliation in our community.

Rev Waymer is excited about the opportunity to serve the great people of Silver Hill Memorial and the surrounding community. He is an excellent servant leader who works with organizations and members because leading by example is essential to him. Listening is one of the most critical keys because people need to be heard and offered grace and compassion. One final thing demonstrates his leadership. Rev. Waymer never takes any credit or praise for all his significant accomplishments. You will hear him say, “To God be the Glory for the great things He has done.”

The Waymer Family is delighted to serve in this new chapter of ministry. If you want to hear more about my story or meet me, please call the church office to schedule an appointment. We are looking forward to meeting you real soon.

Grace and Peace,

Rev. Morris Waymer, Jr.
